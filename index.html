  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This is my coming out party. I'm a writer, a helper, a healer, a human. Multitudes upon Multitudes. Radical Equity is my coming out party. This site will host commentary on the commentators, because reading the headlines isn't enough. What does it all mean? This is so much more than, we read the news so you don't have too. <br /> We are black, indigenous and queer, literally schooled in white supremacy - segragation academy graduate, BA at Mr. Jefferson's University, and MBA from Jefferson's alma mater. This was deliberate o course. Initiate by my parents and carry out to a bitter conclusion by me. Here we will diseminate our learnings using the news of the day. Because it's all just a little bit of history repeating.</p>
  
  <h2>What's this all about?</h2>

  <p>Realms of Equity</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Health/Well-being - How we take care of ourselves and each other</li>
    <li>Right to self-actualization - The real free market is our humanity, not "economic justice"</li>
    <li>Restorative Justice - Acknowledging Karma - let the universe universe</li>
    <li>Open Source - Technology belongs to humanity (free the internet)</li>
  </ul>  

  <p>Three steps out of the quagmire of life:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Education</li>
    <li>(Un)assimilation</li>
    <li>Actualization</li>
  </ol>
